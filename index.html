        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
         I’m a PhD candidate in Civil Engineering at the University of Arkansas and a former Fulbright Scholar, with training in Transportation planning and System Engineering, including a Master of City and Regional Planning from Georgia Tech. Before my PhD, I spent several years as a faculty member at BUET, where I taught transportation-focused courses, supervised theses, and supported curriculum and accreditation work—experiences that shaped my interest in mobility as both an engineered system and an everyday human need.
        </p>
        
        <p>
         My research blends Transportation System Engineering and Travel Behavior Modelling to advance community-centric transportation solutions, shared micro-mobility planning, and transportation safety and accessibility, particularly in small and resource-constrained cities. I examine how people perceive barriers to transit, walking, and biking and how those perceptions influence mode choice and car dependence. In my current role at the University of Arkansas, I help lead applied research and evaluation efforts, including community-centered bikeshare planning and accessibility assessment.
        <p>

        <p> 
          I also contribute to grant development that bridges mobility, equity, and implementation—supporting proposals for public agencies and national programs, as well as serving in leadership roles on funded projects. Alongside research, I bring professional experience from applied planning and infrastructure work, where I have helped supervise projects, develop technical scopes, and deliver analyses that directly inform real-world decisions.
        </p>
        
    
        <h2>Recent Update</h2>

        <p>
          I am attending TRB Annual Meeting in Washington DC from January 11 - January 15 and presenting my research on January 12 "Is the Last Mile Walkable? Exploring Bikeshare-Induced 
          Multimodal Accessibility in Small Urban Networks"
