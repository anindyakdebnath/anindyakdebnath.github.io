        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
          I am a PhD candidate in Civil Engineering at the University of Arkansas (expected May 2026), with an academic foundation in urban and regional planning and Transportation System Engineering. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
          Before starting my PhD, I spent over seven years as a faculty member at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in transportation planning, traffic engineering, statistics, GIS, and participatory planning. 
          Along the way, I supervised student theses and contributed to curriculum and accreditation-related work—experiences that shaped how I approach mobility as both a technical system and a lived, everyday reality. :contentReference
        </p>
        
        <p>
          My research sits at the intersection of Transportation System Engineering and Travel Behavior Modelling, with a focus on community-centric transportation solutions, shared micro-mobility planning, and transportation safety and accessibility—especially in small and resource-constrained cities. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
          I study how people perceive transportation barriers (e.g., whether transit, sidewalks, and bike facilities feel usable) and how those perceptions shape mode choice and car dependence. :contentReference
          At the University of Arkansas, I support this work as a Graduate Research Assistant and ZeRo Lab Manager (Jan 2021–present), including the design and evaluation of the Ride 4 SMILIES bikeshare in Fort Smith, Arkansas. :contentReference
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Grant writing experience.</strong>
          I contribute to interdisciplinary proposal development that connects mobility, equity, and real-world implementation. Most recently, I served as a research team member on a 2025 submission to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for the Rural Health Transformation Program, focused on developing a Health-care Access Prioritization Index (HAPI) in Arkansas (decision pending). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
          I also contributed to a 2024 Arkansas Department of Transportation research needs statement submission and to the 2022 NSF Civic Innovation Challenge proposal that led to the SMILIES award. 
          In addition, my earlier funded research experience includes serving as PI on an SSRC (Bangladesh) grant in 2019 and as Co-PI on a RAJUK-funded project in 2012. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Professional experience &amp; project supervision.</strong>
          Beyond academia, I have contributed to applied planning and infrastructure projects where analysis had to hold up in practice—not just on paper.
          This includes serving as Project Co-PI on “Density Zoning for Dhaka Metropolitan Planning Area” (Mar–May 2019), supporting ToR development for an Upazila Development Plan initiative (Mar–May 2019), and contributing to a UKAID-supported Rural Road Planning and Prioritization Model project (Dec 2017–Aug 2018). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
          Earlier, I worked on feasibility and impact assessment work for a BRAC University campus project (Jun–Sep 2014) and supported integrated WASH planning funded by Unicef/UKAid (Mar 2011–Sep 2013).

        <p>
          I am attending TRB Annual Meeting in Washington DC from January 11 - January 15 and presenting my research on January 12 "Is the Last Mile Walkable? Exploring Bikeshare-Induced 
          Multimodal Accessibility in Small Urban Networks"
